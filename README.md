# Translate books with GPT

This project harnesses the power of GPT-4o-mini LLM to translate eBooks from any language into your preferred language, maintaining the integrity and structure of the original content. Imagine having access to a vast world of literature, regardless of the original language, right at your fingertips.

This tool not only translates the text but also carefully compiles each element of the eBook ‚Äì chapters, footnotes, and all ‚Äì into a perfectly formatted EPUB file. We use the `gpt-4o-mini` model by default to ensure high-quality translations. However, we understand the need for flexibility, so we've made it easy to switch models in `main.py` according to your specific needs.


## üíµ Cost

The cost of translations is pretty low; here is the pricing as 04 january 2025 for gpt-4o-mini:

```bash
$0.225 per 1M input tokens
$0.600 per 1M output tokens
```


The average web novel chapter contain about 2500 tokens (~9000 characters according to https://tokencounter.org/fr). 
### Wich means that translating 400 chapters would cost you about 0.825‚Ç¨, a bit less than 1‚Ç¨.

### Show Chapters

Before diving into translation, it's recommended to use the `show-chapters` mode to review the structure of your book:

```bash
python main.py show-chapters --input yourbook.epub
```

This command will display all the chapters, helping you to plan your translation process effectively.

### Translate Mode

```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --config config.yaml --from-chapter 13 --to-chapter 37 --from-lang EN --to-lang FR
