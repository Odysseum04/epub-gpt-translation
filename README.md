# Translate books with GPT

This project harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4.1-mini to translate eBooks from any language into your preferred language, maintaining the integrity and structure of the original content. Imagine having access to a vast world of literature, regardless of the original language, right at your fingertips.

This tool not only translates the text but also carefully reassembles each element of the eBook ‚Äì chapters, footnotes, and all ‚Äì into a perfectly formatted EPUB file. We use `gpt-4.1-mini` by default for a good balance of quality and cost, but you can easily change the model and other settings in the `config.yaml` file.

## üíµ Cost

The cost of translations using models like `gpt-4.1-mini` is generally quite low. For indicative pricing (please always check OpenAI's official pricing page for the latest rates, for example, as of mid-2025 for `gpt-4.1-mini`):

```
Input: ~$0.50 per 1 million tokens
Output: ~$1.60 per 1 million tokens
```

An average web novel chapter might contain about 2500 tokens (around 9000 characters).
**This means translating a book with 400 such chapters could cost you less than $3 USD.** (Calculation: 400 chapters * 2500 tokens/chapter = 1M input tokens. Assuming output is similar, total cost would be around $0.50 + $1.60 = $2.10).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get the translator up and running on your computer:

1.  **Create a Project Folder:**
    Create a new folder on your machine where you want to store this project. For example, in your "Documents" folder, you could create "novel-translation".

2.  **Open a Terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell/Terminal):**
    *   **Windows:** Search for "cmd" or "PowerShell".
    *   **macOS/Linux:** Search for "Terminal".
    Navigate to the folder you just created. If your folder path is `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\epub-translation`, you would type:
    ```bash
    cd "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\epub-translation"
    ```
    *(Remember the quotes if your path has spaces!)*

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    In the terminal, run this command to download the project files:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Odysseum04/epub-gpt-translation.git
    ```
    This will create a new folder named `epub-gpt-translation` inside your project directory.

4.  **Open the Project:**
    Open the `novel-gpt-translation` folder in your favorite code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, etc.).

5.  **Set up Configuration & API Key:**
    *   Inside the `epub-gpt-translation` folder, find the file named `config.yaml.example`.
    *   **Copy this file and rename the copy to `config.yaml`** in the same directory.
    *   **Open `config.yaml` with your editor.** You'll need to add your OpenAI API key here:
        ```yaml
        openai:
          api_key: "sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your actual key
          # ... other settings ...
        ```
    *   **How to get an OpenAI API Key?** You can find many tutorials online, for example: [YouTube Tutorial Link (General Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU)
    *   **Alternatively (Recommended & More Secure):** Instead of putting the key in `config.yaml`, you can set an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key value. The script will automatically use it if set.

6.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    A virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated. In your terminal (ensure you are inside the `novel-gpt-translation` folder):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv 
    ```
    Then, activate it:
    *   **Windows (cmd):** `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (You might need to allow script execution: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`)
    *   **macOS/Linux:** `source .venv/bin/activate`
    You should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

7.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install `ebooklib`, `beautifulsoup4`, `openai`, `PyYAML`, `tiktoken`, `tqdm`, and `nltk`. NLTK is used for better sentence splitting during translation.

You're all set up!

## üéÆ Usage

The script is run from the terminal, inside the `epub-gpt-translation` folder (make sure your virtual environment is activated).

### Show Chapters

Before translating, it's a good idea to see how the book is structured:
```bash
python main.py show-chapters --input yourbook.epub
```
This command lists the chapters (or document items) in your EPUB file, their approximate size, and a short preview. This helps you decide if you want to translate specific chapters.

### Translate Mode

To translate a book:
```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --from-lang EN --to-lang FR --from-chapter 1 --to-chapter 5
```

**Explanation of options:**

*   `--input yourbook.epub`: Path to the EPUB file you want to translate.
*   `--output translatedbook.epub`: Path where the translated EPUB will be saved.
*   `--from-lang EN`: The language code of the original book (e.g., `EN` for English, `JA` for Japanese, `ZH` for Chinese).
*   `--to-lang FR`: The language code you want to translate to (e.g., `FR` for French, `ES` for Spanish, `DE` for German).
*   `--from-chapter 1` (Optional): The chapter number to start translating from (inclusive). Defaults to the first chapter.
*   `--to-chapter 5` (Optional): The chapter number to end translating at (inclusive). Defaults to the last chapter.
*   `--config config.yaml` (Optional): Path to your configuration file. If not specified, it defaults to `config.yaml` in the current directory.

The script will provide progress updates in the terminal as it processes and translates chapters and chunks of text.

### Advanced Configuration

You can fine-tune the translation process by editing the `config.yaml` file. Settings you can change include:
*   OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`)
*   Translation temperature (creativity vs. precision)
*   Maximum tokens per chunk sent to the API
*   Retry attempts for API calls
*   Logging level
